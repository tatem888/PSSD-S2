Problem 1 - MathNumbersEasy

find longest number of digits (smallest number of matches for highest number) not 0 first
check if changing highest digit can be done with leftovers


Problem 2 - Corporation Salary

Reading this problem initially, it seemes like it should implemented recursivly, going down the chain of command to find the total sallary of thier subordinates. 
By going through the string and finding anyone that doesnt have a subordinate and making my its way down the employement chain until it reaches a base case
(employee with no suborditates) it will build back up with the total Salary.

Recursion os not something i have worked on alot in this course so this will be a goood opportunity to practice and refresh myself

Before implementing, i realised that i had no easy way of telling who was the at the top of any given heirachy, so my implementation would have to start from the bottom 
as that is where i am able to to find workers in the tree from the relations table.

That would still be a difficult way to find the total comapny salary, as i would end up with duplicates of each employee often. I decided i just needed to iterate through each employee, 
who would find their salary nd add it to the total

I knew this solution would be quite inefficient as it would constantly be recalculating some of the employee salaries when it didnt need to, but i just wanted to implement a solution and test it on small sets,
before implementing a DP solution that would make it much more efficient.

My intitial solution worked, and allowed me to implement the DP solution with confidence that my logic was correct.
